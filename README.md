# Hardhat Contract Lottery

A decentralized lottery implemented as a Solidity smart contract using Hardhat.

## Overview

This project is a simple decentralized lottery application built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can participate in the lottery by sending a certain amount of ether to the contract, and a winner is randomly selected after a specified period. The smart contract is developed using the Hardhat framework, which provides a robust development environment for Ethereum projects.

## Features

- **Decentralized**: The lottery is implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Random Selection**: The winner is chosen randomly to ensure a fair distribution of prizes.
- **Hardhat Integration**: Utilizes Hardhat for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.
